#My dotfiles

Primarily for my own use.  *Sanity check* recommended before use.

To install
* Clone the repo
* run `make` to link the files and install submodules
* to uninstall or remove conflicting links use `make clean` 
* or use `make destroy` (non-interactive)

Known issues
* my omz set up and prompt are not handled by script
* neither is my xmonad folder at the moment
