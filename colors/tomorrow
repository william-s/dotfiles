!-- Tomorrow Color Scheme

! Names of the original color are in parenthesis.

! With the exception of DarkYellow (which is Orange) and Yellow
! (which is Yellow), bright colors were derived by simply upping the 'value'
! of each color by 22.  This number was derived from maxing out the value on
! Red.
